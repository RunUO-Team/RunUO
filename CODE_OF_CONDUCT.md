# Code of Conduct

## Our Focus

This project is dedicated to developing and maintaining high-quality code for the RunUO server emulator. All interactions should center around technical discussions, code improvements, and project development.

## Expected Behavior

- **Focus on the code**: Keep discussions technical and project-related
- **Be constructive**: Provide actionable feedback and suggestions
- **Share knowledge**: Help others understand the codebase and contribute effectively
- **Test thoroughly**: Ensure your contributions work as expected
- **Document clearly**: Write clear commit messages and code comments
- **Follow standards**: Adhere to established coding conventions and practices

## Unacceptable Behavior

- **Breaking builds**: Submitting code that doesn't compile or breaks functionality
- **Ignoring feedback**: Dismissing technical reviews without consideration
- **Poor communication**: Being unclear about technical issues or changes
- **Security violations**: Introducing vulnerabilities or exposing sensitive data
- **Spam or off-topic content**: Non-technical discussions that derail development

## Technical Standards

- All code must compile without errors
- Follow existing code style and naming conventions
- Include appropriate error handling
- Write meaningful commit messages

- Respond to code review feedback promptly

## Enforcement

Maintainers will address violations by:
1. Requesting technical corrections

3. Reverting problematic commits
4. Restricting repository access for repeated violations

This is a technical project. Keep it technical.
